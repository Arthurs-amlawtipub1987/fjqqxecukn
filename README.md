OMG, dude, just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Mountainhead and my brain's a hot mess. Like, I have no words but also, you know, ALL the words? So, right off the bat, whoever designed those mountain shots, they deserve a freakin' medal. You could practically feel the cold through the screen. I should’ve just 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥ed the   for that alone, seriously.

The plot, tho, bit of a rollercoaster. Kept swinging between ‘what the actual hell?’ and ‘I think I kinda get it now?’ Haha, who am I kidding, still don’t get it. Characters were a wild bunch – the main guy, oh man, he’s like if anxiety had an avatar. You know what I mean? But then there’s this bit where he just flips and starts doing all this philosophical ranting in the middle of nowhere. Like, dude, just chill, we all know you’re deep.

> Honestly, my head hurts trying to keep up with the plot twists. I kept saying, “Is this real life, or are we just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Inception with more snow?” 😂 The soundtrack slaps, though. Whoever thought of mixing indie rock with shots of total wilderness is a genius or something. Anyway, kinda makes me wanna grab my boots and go hiking, but no thanks, I’m tired just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨.

Speaking of tired, remember back when we used to binge like 3-4  s in a row? Don't know how we managed that. Now after just one, I feel like I need a nap or something. By the way, you should definitely 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   ASAP, if you haven’t already, just to see if anyone else feels as utterly confused as I do.

let me get the pizza = extra cheese;

So all in all, I’d say try not to overthink it too much. Just soak in the views and let the madness unfold, you know? Anyway, I’m grabbing some snacks cuz intense   𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 really works up an appetite. Catch you later! 🍿
